Weather Station Project: A compact system designed to measure environmental conditions using a Raspberry Pi and various sensors. It tracks room and surface temperatures, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind speed and direction, and rainfall levels.

Components:

Raspberry Pi (central unit)
Anemometer (wind speed)
Wind Vane (direction)
DS18B20 Probe (surface temp)
Rain Gauge (rainfall)
BME280 Sensor (room temp, pressure, humidity)


Purpose: Provides accurate, real-time environmental data for various applications.


In order to run the code, download all the files in a raspberry Pi with all the sensors connected. 
Then run the batch file run.sh your output will be logged in cron.log file.
